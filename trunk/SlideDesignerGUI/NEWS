		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.3


NEW FEATURES

    o	Loading Tk resource database from application default
	files now handled by tkloadappdefaults() method rather
	than by code added to package in last revision.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.2


NEW FEATURES

    o	Mostly minor tweaks to standardize coding with other
	Tcl/Tk GUI packages. As part of that, common routines
	were moved into new package dependency. Also, appdefault
	handling was added.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	Adds checkbox that saves output as though one large grid.
	This will allow SuperCurve to handle some datafiles that
	were generated by labs using single MV main row/col.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Now generates a GridAlias column for the TSV file that
	uniquely identifies all related samples; samples within
	a particular series will have the same grid alias.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.2.0

	currently being used by Core Labs for slide design.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.1.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Dilution series now generated according to user input
	value rather than changing series when control encountered.
	If there is one series per row, there can be any number of
	samples spots in the row - all of which are included in the
	series. If there is more than one series per row, all rows
	must contain the same number of sample spots. Additionally,
	the number of sample spots per row must be an integer
	multiple of the number of series per row.

    o	SubRow and SubCol default values changed to match those
	currently being used by Core Labs for slide design.


BUG FIXES

    o	Initial display of subgrid could exceed screen dimensions
	if large value given. The window geometry is now constrained
	to the screen dimensions.

    o	Removed extra column when viewing subgrid in table after
	assembly. The column was not actually part of the subgrid
	itself, but added by the R method that displayed the table.
