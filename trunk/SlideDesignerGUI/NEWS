		CHANGES IN SLIDEDESIGNERGUI VERSION 1.1.0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES


NEW FEATURES

    o   Dilution series now generated according to user input
	value rather than changing series when control encountered.
	If there is one series per row, there can be any number of
	samples spots in the row - all of which are included in the
	series. If there is more than one series per row, all rows
	must contain the same number of sample spots. Additionally,
	the number of sample spots per row must be an integer
	multiple of the number of series per row.

BUG FIXES

    o	Removed extra column when viewing subgrid in table after
	assembly. The column was not actually part of the subgrid
	itself, but added by the R method that displayed the table.
