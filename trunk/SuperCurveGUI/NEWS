		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.0.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Creation of package so that Tcl/Tk requirement would not affect
	people who only wish to use package SuperCurve without the GUI.

    o	Renamed sc() as supercurveGUI().

    o	Added filters to file selection dialogs.


BUG FIXES

    o	Changed output directory selection dialog to not require an
	existing file, avoiding first-use "chicken & egg" scenario.

    o	Added appropriate dialog titles where necessary.
