		CHANGES IN SUPERCURVE VERSION 1.1.0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added first draft of spatialNorm() function for
	topographical normalization.

    o	Added 'software' argument to RPPA() and RPPASet() generators
	to enable user-defined function to handle reading data
	from quantification files.

    o	Added dim(RPPA) and dim(RPPADesign) methods which return
	the slide layout dimensions.

    o	Updated the summary(RPPA), summary(RPPADesign), and
	summary(RPPAFit) methods to produce better summary information.
	Removed summary(RPPAFitParams) method as output was sometimes
	incorrect depending on how object was created.

    o	Added 'call' slot to RPPADesign object.

    o	Added metadata from the quantification file to the RPPA
	'data' slot object.

    o	Updated tests for FitClass derived objects such that they
	now require that SUPERCURVE_FULL_TEST environment variable
	be defined. This was done in an effort to reduce the time
	required to run R CMD check for the package.

    o	Modified code such that the RPPADesignParams() generator
	now allows the 'controls' argument to also be specified
	as a character vector.

    o	Vignette updated to current code.


BUG FIXES

    o	Corrected code within RPPASet() generator to handle directory
	with no quantification files and handle bad/invalid layout
	information file.

		CHANGES IN SUPERCURVE VERSION 1.0.1


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added additional information to summary(RPPAFit) method.


BUG FIXES

    o	Corrected code responsible for fitting the dilution series
	so that the regression method now actually invokes the
	function representing the model for the slide (evaulation
	occurring in wrong environment).

    o	Patched code such that image(RPPAFit) method could be found
	when called from write.summary() function.

    o	Fixed refactoring bug in RPPADesign() generator dealing with
	alias defaults.

    o	Modified tests to use fewer digits for better cross-platform
	compatibility.


		CHANGES IN SUPERCURVE VERSION 1.0.0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES


NEW FEATURES

    o	Massive rewrite of documentation. Earlier vignette also updated
	to current code.

    o	Massive code cleanup.

    o	Actually passes R CMD check...

    o	RPPAFitDir() method renamed as RPPASet() generator.

    o	Ordering and contents of RPPADesignParams() and RPPAFitParams()
	generators changed.

    o	Updated the code to draw colorbar in image(RPPA) method so that
	it's more likely to actually be drawn in smaller window sizes.

    o	Much more error checking for bad arguments in all functions.

    o	RPPA() generator now allows 'file' argument to be a connection.

    o	Tcl/Tk GUI is now in its own package SuperCurveGUI.


BUG FIXES

    o	Updated dataset objects to R-2.7.

    o   Removed slot 'p.values' included in RPPAFit objects as it
	wasn't being used.

    o	Fixed plots for RPPAFit objects so that the various 'type'
	arguments now work as expected.

    o	Fixed warnings about graphical parameters that came from running
	write.summary() function.

    o	Identifies if non-MicroVigene datafile is passed to RPPA() generator.

    o	Checks that 'measure' argument to image(RPPA) method specifies
	a valid column name from its 'data' slot.
