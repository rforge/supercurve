		CHANGES IN SUPERCURVE VERSION 1.3.3


NEW FEATURES

    o	Output filenames now converted to POSIX portable filename
	when writing files to disk. Prevents names of antibodies
	from possibly being used for malicious purposes.


		CHANGES IN SUPERCURVE VERSION 1.3.2


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added the 'antibody' argument to RPPA() generator to allow
	specifying its name within the object. This change also
	impacts the RPPA class definition to add corresponding slot.

    o	Added the 'antibodyfile' argument to RPPASet() generator
	to allow antibodies to be specified when RPPA instances
	created. Antibodies are now used as rownames (rather than
	the quantification filenames) in the resulting class.

    o	Removed alias information loading code from RPPASet()
	generator. This is now handled completely by RPPADesignParams()
	generator.

    o	Multitude of small updates to the package's graphics methods.
	Plot titles standardized for all methods. Axes from image()
	methods now display tickmarks in multiples of Sub.Row and
	Sub.Col. Pointless labels removed in several places. All
	graphic output is now titled, nominally with reference to
	measure and antibody in main title, and filename in subtitle.

BUG FIXES

    o	RPPASet() generator used regular expression to determine
	quantification files to be read that included files ending
	with "txt" without being the file extension.


		CHANGES IN SUPERCURVE VERSION 1.3.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	Both RPPA() and RPPADesignParams() generators now allow
	use of absolute pathnames for file arguments. If absolute
	pathname is specified, the 'path' argument is ignored.

    o	Added 'aliasfile', 'designfile', and 'path' arguments
	to RPPADesignParams() generator and RPPADesign() method.
	The previous experimental capability to pass filename to
	'controls' argument of either function was removed in favor
	of more explicit 'designfile' argument.

    o   Added 'aliasfile' and 'designfile' slots to RPPADesignParams
        object.

    o   Modified slot types for 'alias' and 'controls' slots of
	RPPADesignParams object to allow NULL.

    o   Modified slot type for 'xform' slot of RPPAFitParams object
	to allow NULL.

BUG FIXES

    o	RPPA() generator now allows 'path' argument to be empty string.

    o	Added error checking to registerModel() method to verify
	that 'classname' argument is subclass of 'FitClass'.

    o	On Windows, calls to message() method were not being flushed;
	now progress is reported while computations are in progress.


		CHANGES IN SUPERCURVE VERSION 1.3.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added spatialCorrection() method to perform topographical
	adjustment for slides prior to performing fit.

    o	Added SuperCurveSettings class, generator, and
	fitCurveAndSummarizeFromSettings() method to make it simpler
	to repeat a previous analysis. This will be the new interface
	used by SuperCurveGUI package.

    o	Added initial implementation of data-driven access for
	normalize() method and FitClass model via registration. This
	provides means for user code to be incorporated into SuperCurve
	processing. This functionality is also used by SuperCurveGUI
	package.

    o	Added validity function for RPPADesign class.

    o	Added temporary capability to pass filename to 'controls'
	argument of RPPADesignParams() generator. Filename specifies
	slide design information. As such, the actual controls
	are automagically specified when RPPADesign instance is
	created. This feature should be considered experimental.

    o	Now checks the quantification data.frame from readQuantification()
	method to verify expected columns.

UTILITIES

    o	Updated scripts to create R objects from raw data provided
	with the package.


BUG FIXES

    o	Disallowed use of character vector inside list in 'controls'
        argument of RPPADesignParams() generator. Change is not
	backwards compatible.

    o	RPPA() generator now checks that both 'file' and 'path'
	arguments are not empty strings.

    o	Now checks the 'path' argument of write.summary() method to
	ensure results directory can be writable.

    o	Corrected error message in readQuantification() method that
	displayed connection number rather than the intended filename.

    o	Corrected check in readQuantification() method that was supposed
	to verify the 'tiffdir' argument was a directory.

		CHANGES IN SUPERCURVE VERSION 1.2.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Modified the trimConc(FitClass) generic method to require
	additional 'trimLevel' argument (and methods for each
	provided FitClass subclasses).

    o	Modified the 'trim' argument of both RPPAFit() and
	RPPAFitParams() generators to handle passing a numeric scalar.
	This change also impacts the RPPAFitParams class definition
	as its slot there changed from logical to numeric type.


BUG FIXES

		CHANGES IN SUPERCURVE VERSION 1.1.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added first draft of spatialNorm() function for
	topographical normalization.

    o	Added 'software' argument to RPPA() and RPPASet() generators
	to enable user-defined function to handle reading data
	from quantification files.

    o	Added dim(RPPA) and dim(RPPADesign) methods which return
	the slide layout dimensions.

    o	Updated the summary(RPPA), summary(RPPADesign), and
	summary(RPPAFit) methods to produce better summary information.
	Removed summary(RPPAFitParams) method as output was sometimes
	incorrect depending on how object was created.

    o	Added 'call' slot to RPPADesign object.

    o	Added metadata from the quantification file to the RPPA
	'data' slot object.

    o	Updated tests for FitClass derived objects such that they
	now require that SUPERCURVE_FULL_TEST environment variable
	be defined. This was done in an effort to reduce the time
	required to run R CMD check for the package.

    o	Modified code such that the RPPADesignParams() generator
	now allows the 'controls' argument to also be specified
	as a character vector.

    o	Vignette updated to current code.


BUG FIXES

    o	Merging output graphs by write.summary() method (which requires
	ImageMagick's 'convert') now works correctly on Windows platform.

    o	Plots generated by write.summary() method are now created on
	white background. The original code was "copying" the screen
	device to create the PNG files; since most screen devices
	default to a transparent background, the resulting plots (and
	merged output graph) were hard to read when generated on certain
	platforms (depending on default device).

    o	Corrected code within RPPASet() generator to handle directory
	with no quantification files and handle bad/invalid layout
	information file.

		CHANGES IN SUPERCURVE VERSION 1.0.1


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added additional information to summary(RPPAFit) method.


BUG FIXES

    o	Corrected code responsible for fitting the dilution series
	so that the regression method now actually invokes the
	function representing the model for the slide (evaulation
	occurring in wrong environment).

    o	Patched code such that image(RPPAFit) method could be found
	when called from write.summary() function.

    o	Fixed refactoring bug in RPPADesign() generator dealing with
	alias defaults.

    o	Modified tests to use fewer digits for better cross-platform
	compatibility.

	arguments now work as expected.

    o	Fixed warnings about graphical parameters that came from running
	write.summary() function.

    o	Identifies if non-MicroVigene datafile is passed to RPPA() generator.

	a valid column name from its 'data' slot.
